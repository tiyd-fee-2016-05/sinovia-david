Revenge of Octocat

The first afternoon, David and Sinovia worked together on the basic layout of the page.  They pair programmed a large part of the static layout and were each assigned each assigned specific tabs of the static layout to complete independently.  

David completed:
  - Overview and Public Activity Tab
  

Sinovia completed:
Repository tab and saved JSON files to sinovia-david repository.

We both answered the questions independently.
